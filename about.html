        <h2>Much like a public hospital, as an open-admission shelter,
        The Animal Foundation takes in every animal who comes to us in need,
        no matter how sick or injured. From the expected dogs and cats,
        we serve them all. Just like a hospital, we canâ€™t save them all.
        What we can do, with the support of the community,
        is save every healthy and treatable animal who comes to us in need.</h2>
